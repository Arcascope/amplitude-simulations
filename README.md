# Simulations of circadian amplitude

This repository contains the code needed to generate the figures in "Beyond phase shifting: Amplitude as a target for circadian light interventions." by Olivia Walch, Franco Tavella, Jamie Zeitzer, and Renske Lok.


Figure 1, which shows phase and amplitude response curves, can be found in the `ipynb` notebooks `amplitude_boost_simulations.ipynb` and `amplitude_boost_plots.ipynb.`

Figure 2, which shows how more light tends to hit during the amplitude suppression region as sleep irregularity increases is in `make_sleep_irregularity_figure.py`

Figure 3, which is an explainer image for two definitions of amplitude, is generated by `make_melatonin_figure.py`
